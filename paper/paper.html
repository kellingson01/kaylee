<h1><a href="https://www.blueponyk12.com/">Good Website #1</a></h1>
<p>I believe it is said to be a "good" website because when you minimize the screen and make the resolution smaller, it makes it easy to navigate like if you were on a cellular device.  Like many websites, the Havre Public Schools webpage has many tabs that leads you to more information which makes it easier to navigate.  In the code, it looks confusing to me because it is just a lot of stuff that doesn't look familiar.  They use many scripts and div id elements.  When you scroll through the website, the top navigation bar stays at the top.  When you minimize the resolution of the page, all those tabs in the navigation bar turns into a hamburger menu and drops down to many categories that are in the website.  The main color on the website is blue and this reallly light grey.  Which matches really well with the theme of the website because the Havre High School's mascot is the blue ponies.  On the slide show part at the top of the home page, they don't use margins. Say if you press on the "SCHOOLS" tab and go down and click the "Havre High School" tab, they have a column on the left side of the page that shows you many different options from Havre High School.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.carroll.edu/">Good Website #2</a></h2>
<p>I believe it is said to be a "good" website because like the other website above, it is easy to use when the resolution is small and while using on a cellular device.  The Carroll College website has many tabs for you to navigate through the website and make what you are looking for a lot easier.  The code is a lot for me but it is easy to understand and what to make out of it.  They use a lot of div and classes.  The colors are purple and white which makes sense since one of Carroll College's school colors is purple.  It makes the website look nicer.  It has cool effects like when you hover over a picture and there are a lot of pictures of the school's community which makes it nice and comforting.  </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.pennyjuice.com/childcare-juice-concentrates">Bad Website #1</a></h3>
<p>I believe it is said to be a "bad" website because the website is all over the place.  When you minimize the page, to make it for cellular device users, it makes things complicated to use and even navigate.  The text is hard to read when it is minimized because it isn't stacked up on each other, you have to scroll to the left and right in order to read everything.  The bar at the top of the page stays at the top but a little more down rather at the very top while you are scrolling.  The website is about fruit juice concentrate but it is hard to understand.  The colors on the page are bright and I get it is suppose to represent for children and juice but I just don't think it goes well.  The coding to me is confusing and maybe because it is too advanced for me to understand.  </p>
