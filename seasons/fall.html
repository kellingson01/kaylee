	<p>Fall is the time kids go back to school, watching football games, and drinking those pumpkin spice lattes!  During this time you notice the leaves start to change to an exotic orange, yellow, and red color.  You get to dress up as anything you want and not feel ashamed about the amount of candy you have consumed.  It is the time to get together with friends and family and give thanks to the people and things you love, while eating an abundance amount of food with some pumpkin pie at the end.  </p>
