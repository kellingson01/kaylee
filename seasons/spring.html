	<p>Spring is the symbol of rebirth.  Spring is the time you get to see the flowers blossom, the grass becoming green, and the weather becoming warmer by the day.  The birds come back and you see baby animals everywhere.  If you look in a religious point of view, it is the time when Jesus Christ died on the cross and was reborn.  Easter is during this time and you get to visit the Easter bunny and get to search for easter eggs and eat loads of candy.  </p>
