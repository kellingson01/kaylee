	<p>Summer is a wonderful time!  When you think of summer, it usually means no school and having fun!  Even if you work a full time job, the summer is the time you get to go to the lake or the beach and jump and cool off in the water!  You get to get together with friends and families on the weekends and have a big ol' barbeque and enjoy the lovely weather!  Lay out by the pool, lake, or ocean getting them tan lines and lighter hair!  Nothing can go wrong during the summer!</p>
