	<p>Brrrr!  Winter is the time you get to dress in bulky sweaters with a warm fuzzy blanket while wearing some fuzzy socks all cozied up by a fire drinking some hot cocoa.  Maybe going outside to build a snowman or building a snow fort and having a snowball fight with some friends and family.  Watching your favorite Christmas movies while opening up presents on Christmas day and having the joy of being wth your family.  Eating turkey and stuffing and then after that, going outside and sledding with your friends.  </p>
