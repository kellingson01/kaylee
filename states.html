		<li>1. Montana</li>
			<p>Like Arizona's page, it makes it easy to use for people on cell phones.  The site is very easy to navigate and gives several key aspects on what you are looking for on the first page.  The website gives you many tabs to click on for more information on what you are looking for.  It also gives you many aspects on what Montana looks like from the gorgeous lakes and mountains to the plains.</p>
		<li>2. Alaska</li>
			<p>On Alaska's web page, it does not make it compatable for phone users.  I feel like it is pretty easy to use and navigate.  Everything you need to know is basically on the first page from knowing about the government, articles, events, and breaking news.  It gives you information on who the govenor is, how the court system and the legislative branch is ran. </p>
			
		<li>3. Nebraska</li>
			<p>The website makes it easy for cell phone users.  At the bottom of the page it gives you statistics on the state.  It lets you know of the events that are happening.  The site doesn't give you a whole lot to go on or look off of if you do not know what you are searching for.  It is really easy to know about Nebraska's government.</p>
		
		<li>4. New Hampshire</li>
			<p>This site does not make it easy for cell phone users to use, it cuts off half of the page.  It gives you upcoming events and news on the first page at the bottom.  Many of the tabs make it easy for you to find what you are looking for.  Unlike the other websites it doesn't tell you much about the government on the first page just the name of the govenor.  </p>
		<li>5. Arizona</li>
			<p>It makes it easy for people who look up the website on their phone to use.  The website doesn't give you any information on the first page.  You have to click on different tabs to find the information you need. They provide really pretty pictures when you open the website up, but that can be misleading due to the fact Arizona is just a dessert and the whole state is not that pretty. </p>
